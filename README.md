Use make to compile the project and the minilibx (source : https://github.com/42paris/minilibx-linux.git)

Usage : ./so_long map.ber

The map has to be rectangular, contain at least 1 starting point, 1 exit, and 1 collectibles.
The map has to be enclosed by walls ('1'), an empty space ('0'), collectibles are 'C', exit is 'E', and starting point is 'P'.

The player has 4 different frames representing its direction. All the textures are .xpm files

I drew the collectibles, the starting position and the exit, the rest is from :
